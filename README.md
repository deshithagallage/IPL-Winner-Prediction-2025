# IPL Winner Prediction 2025

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the match winners of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 matches. The model leverages historical IPL data from 2008 to 2024, including team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes, to forecast the potential winners. The project also includes a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

The repository contains:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Scripts to gather and clean IPL data from various sources.
- Model Development: Code for building, training, and evaluating different machine learning models.
- User Interface: A web application to input match details and display predictions.
- Documentation: Detailed documentation and instructions for running the project.
